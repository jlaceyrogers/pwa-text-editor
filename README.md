# Just Another Text Editor

Welcome to Just Another Text Editor! This repository contains the code for a simple text editor web application. The application utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a user-friendly interface for editing and saving text content. It also incorporates IndexedDB for local data storage and Workbox for service worker management.

## Features

- **Editor Interface**: The application provides an intuitive and responsive text editor interface powered by CodeMirror.

- **Local Storage**: Text content can be saved locally using the browser's local storage feature, ensuring content is retained across sessions.

- **IndexedDB Integration**: The application leverages IndexedDB to store and retrieve user content, providing a more robust and persistent data storage solution.

- **Install Prompt**: The app includes a button that becomes visible when the browser supports adding the app to the home screen. This allows users to install the app for quick access.

- **Service Worker**: A service worker is registered using Workbox to enable offline functionality and improve performance by caching resources.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository-url>`.

2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd just-another-text-editor`.

3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to launch the application.

## Code Overview

- The `index.html` file contains the main structure of the web application, including the editor interface and navigation bar.

- CSS styling is defined in the `style.css` file, providing a consistent and visually appealing design.

- JavaScript functionality is split across multiple files:
  - `editor.js`: Defines the text editor class and its behavior, including interaction with IndexedDB.
  - `database.js`: Handles interactions with IndexedDB, including storing and retrieving data.
  - `main.js`: Contains event listeners and app initialization, including handling the install prompt and service worker registration.

## Usage

1. Open the application in a web browser.

2. Start typing in the text editor to create or modify content.

3. Edits will be automatically saved to local storage. IndexedDB is also utilized for more reliable data storage.

4. If supported by the browser, the "Install" button will appear, allowing you to add the app to your home screen.

## Browser Compatibility

This application is designed to work across modern web browsers with support for service workers, IndexedDB, and CSS variables.
